The ripples forms are carved by water, and keep a record of the river's current. Ripples form as water erodes sediment on the upstream (stoss) side of a bank and quickly deposit it on the downstream (lee) side.  These scallop-shaped structures are called catenary ripples, which suggest a faster flow. Today there is no current in the bottom reaches of Cottonwood Canyon as it lies below Lake Powell.

The varnish is composed of a thin gloss of sediment, minerals, and microbes interacting with one another over long periods of time, and is encouraged by water seeps, which might account for the striping patterns seen here. It takes more than 1,000 years for the varnish to accumulate to the width of a human hair. Much about the formation of desert varnish is still a mystery--it is not fully understood why varnish forms in some conditions and not others. Indigenous artists often chose varnished surfaces to etch petroglyphs as the underlying sandstone constrasted with the darknened varnish.

Pedestal rocks can also form as wind plucks sand from the ground and blasts the rock. Typically sand blasts are strongest at lower heights.
